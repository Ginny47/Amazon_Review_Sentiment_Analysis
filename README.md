# Amazon_Review_Sentiment_Analysis
The use of sentiment analysis on Amazon review datasets is beneficial in 3 ways. (1) Increase online sales (2) Improve business prospects, and (3) Maintain excellent customer satisfaction. The goal of this project is to study the correlation between product values and scores through sentiment analysis.

Apply 4 different deep learning models and 1 machine learning model on the same Amazon review training and testing dataset. Compare accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC AUC score of the 5 models. Logistic Regression with Tf-Idf (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) model shows the highest rates in all comparison categories.
